PaletteUI is an experimental UI component library 📚 referencing unique design patterns on existing user interface. Build your next web application with our boilerplate React code ⚛️ and customise the CSS to your own need.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Check dependency for each project**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the minimal starter.

   We use libraries and packages for better code readability and performance optimisation. You can find them at the info section on each project page.

2.  **Visit the repository folder on Github**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

   You will find a index.js file and index.module.css on each project.

3.  **Copy and paste the code**

    After installing the required dependencies, copy the React code and its stylesheet to your own project.

4.  **Modify your CSS**

    As every project is written in plain old CSS, you can adapt the existing styles to any preferred CSS frameworks.
